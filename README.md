# Readme Neav UI (fan update)

## Changes and additions

- Option to have a vertical petbar (see nMainbar_Config.lua)
- Short value formatting for player, target, pet and party frames is different (e.g. 1.1m instead of 1M 100K)
- Healthbar on tooltips now have a textual representation on it as well
- Added Blizzards holy power, eclipse and soulshard bars, they fit the UI very nice
- Removed cursor coordinates for map simply becuase it doesn't really work anymore with the smaller map
- Fixed position and font size for player coordinates

**Raid frames**

- Now using the built-in heal prediction from oUF (kind of like healcomm)
- Healing indicators for all classes (I hope), as well as soulstone, focus magic and dark intent
- Healing indicators now have a "cooldown spiral for duration"
- Mouse-over indicator (darkening the color when hovering over a frame)
- Raid frames is a bit modified, now using the built-in heal prediction from oUF. And added healing indicators for all classes (I hope).
