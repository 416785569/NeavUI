# Readme Neav UI (fan update)

## Changes and additions

**oUF_Neav:**

- Short value formatting for player, target, pet and party frames is different (e.g. 1.1m instead of 1M 100K).
- Added Blizzards holy power, eclipse and soulshard bars, they fit the UI very nicely.

**Raid frames:**

- Now using the built-in heal prediction from oUF (kind of like healcomm).
- Healing indicators for all classes (I hope), as well as soulstone, focus magic and dark intent.
- Healing indicators now have a "cooldown spiral" for duration.
- Mouse-over indicator (darkening the color when hovering over a frame).
- Raid frames is a bit modified, now using the built-in heal prediction from oUF. And added healing indicators for all classes (I hope).

**nMainbar:**

- Option to have a vertical petbar (see nMainbar_Config.lua).

**Misc:**

- Healthbar on tooltips now have a textual representation on it as well.
- Removed cursor coordinates for map simply because it doesn't really work anymore with the smaller map.
- Fixed position and font size for player coordinates.
- Added a copy chat function to nChat, use it by right-clicking on the chat tab. Also added a URL copy function.

## Known issues

- The quest blob on the map is still a cause for taint, not really sure what's causing it and if it really needs fixing.
- ActionButtonText occasionally causes taint that blocks right-click cancelling of buffs. This might actually be a bug on Blizzards end though.

Seems like taint are the only issues left, they don't seem overly important but bad nonetheless.
