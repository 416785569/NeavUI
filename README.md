# Readme Neav UI (fan update)

## Changes and additions

**oUF_Neav**

- Short value formatting for player, target, pet and party frames is different (e.g. 1.1m instead of 1M 100K).
- Added Blizzards holy power, eclipse and soulshard bars, they fit the UI very nice.
- **Raid frames:**
-- Now using the built-in heal prediction from oUF (kind of like healcomm).
-- Healing indicators for all classes (I hope), as well as soulstone, focus magic and dark intent.
-- Healing indicators now have a "cooldown spiral for duration".
-- Mouse-over indicator (darkening the color when hovering over a frame).
-- Raid frames is a bit modified, now using the built-in heal prediction from oUF. And added healing indicators for all classes (I hope).

**nMainbar**

- Option to have a vertical petbar (see nMainbar_Config.lua).

**Misc**

- Healthbar on tooltips now have a textual representation on it as well.
- Removed cursor coordinates for map simply becuase it doesn't really work anymore with the smaller map.
- Fixed position and font size for player coordinates.
- Added a copy chat function to nChat, use it by right-clicking on the chat tab. Also added a URL copy function.
