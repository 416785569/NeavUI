This UI has some modifications and additions compared to the original Neav UI such as:

* Option to have a vertical petbar
* Short value formatting is different (e.g. 1.1m instead of 1M 100K)
* Healthbar on tooltips now have a textual representation as well
* Raid frames is a bit modified, now using the built-in heal prediction from oUF. And easier to healing indicators for multiple classes
